# Junior the developer productivity tools

Hi!

This is just a personal project for personal use but if you find it useful, just go and use it!

Currently includes:

* Pomodoro timer
* Todo list
* Code snippets

## Installing

You can find the pre-built binaries in: https://github.com/sinanislekdemir/junior/releases/tag/v0.0.1

Currently built for Linux and Windows. If you have a Mac, I would appreciate you to build the binary. It should just build without code changes.


You can find the pre-built binaries in the release page. If you want to build it for yourself, you'll need Lazarus. So, go checkout [https://www.lazarus-ide.org/](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).

## Why Lazarus?

Well. Why not? It took me just 15 minutes to do this :D No one will give me a cool badge if I had used C++ or Rust :D 

Lazarus / Freepascal compiles statically and nicely on MacOS, Windows and Linux as well as Android. So why bother?

## Help wanted

I need someone to install Lazarus on Mac and do a Mac Os build for the release :)
