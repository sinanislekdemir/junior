# Junior the developer productivity tools

Hi!

This is just a personal project for personal use but if you find it useful, just go and use it!

You can find the pre-built binaries in the release page. If you want to build it for yourself, you'll need Lazarus. So, go checkout [https://www.lazarus-ide.org/](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).

## Why Lazarus?

Well. Why not? It took me just 15 minutes to do this :D No one will give me a cool badge if I had used C++ or Rust :D 

Lazarus / Freepascal compiles statically and nicely on MacOS, Windows and Linux as well as Android. So why bother?
